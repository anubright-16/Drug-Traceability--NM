# Drug-Traceability--NM

We developed a decentralized drug traceability system using React for the user interface and Solidity for blockchain smart contracts, ensuring transparent and secure tracking of pharmaceutical products. Our project aims to enhance the integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain by providing a clear record of drug production, distribution, and consumption. This not only helps in preventing counterfeit drugs from entering the market but also aids in efficient recall of drugs if needed. The use of blockchain technology ensures that the data is immutable and verifiable, thereby increasing trust in the system. The user-friendly interface designed with React makes it easy for all stakeholders to interact with the system. This innovative solution revolutionizes the pharmaceutical industry by bringing transparency, security, and efficiency to drug traceability.
