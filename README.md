# Drug-Traceability--NM

We developed a decentralized drug traceability system using React for the user interface and Solidity for blockchain smart contracts, ensuring transparent and secure tracking of pharmaceutical products. Our project aims to enhance the integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain by providing a clear record of drug production, distribution, and consumption. This not only helps in preventing counterfeit drugs from entering the market but also aids in efficient recall of drugs if needed.
